# Vim Configuration Files

## Overview

I use text based editors for speed.  I don't like to move my hand off of
  the keyboard since this reduces flow and speed in general.  I also cut my
  teeth on BSD UN*X back in the day with _vi_.

I liked to partition my configurations as much as possible to provide
  compartmentalization for different functionality.  I have a top level
  vimrc dotfile which include the other configuration files.  This allows
  me to easily swap in and out different functionality depending upon the
  environment in which I might be working.

## Customization

* _.vimrc_

This is my top level startup dotfile.  It include the other settings and
sets my desired colorschme

* _.vim/setting/_

This is the directory which I use for all of my configurations files.

* _.vim/setting/abbreviation.vim_

This file contains various addreviations.  For me these typically are for
coding shortcuts similar to _Snippets_.

* _.vim/setting/autocommand.vim_

* _.vim/setting/command.vim_

* _.vim/setting/general.vim_

* _.vim/setting/keymapping.vim_

* _.vim/setting/plugin.vim_
